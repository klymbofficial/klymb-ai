/**
 * Who gets the 8 PM System Design reminder, and for what. Pure, so it is
 * unit-tested; /api/cron/sd-reminders only loads the rows and sends.
 *
 * Lessons go live by being added to LESSON_RELEASES. The route also checks
 * lib/sd-pace, so nobody is pointed at a lesson that isn't open to them yet
 * and the refund is only mentioned while it can be earned. "Missed today" means
 * an enrolled learner passed no lesson check today (IST). They are pointed at
 * the first lesson in course order that is out and not passed. Once every
 * lesson in the course is passed, the final assessment is the target. A
 * learner who has passed everything that is out is caught up and left alone,
 * and the day a new lesson ships they are due again, with no change here.
 *
 * Cadence, so a learner who has stepped away isn't mailed every night for
 * weeks: daily for the first three reminders in a row, then every third day,
 * then weekly from the tenth. Passing any lesson starts the count again.
