        <p>
          If you complete the 30-day program, we refund <strong>100% of the fee you paid</strong>: currently{" "}
          are priced from {formatINR(priceFrom)} to {formatINR(priceTo)}). The guarantee exists because the programme only works if you do the work, and
          we would rather be paid by people who did not finish than keep money from people who did.

        <p>
          It is a genuine refund of the full amount, not credit, not points, and not a discount on a future cohort.

          You do not need to apply. Your reviewer confirms completion after Day 30 and we start the refund. If we think
          you have not met a condition, we will tell you which one and why before closing the matter, and you can dispute it.

          If we do not run a cohort you have paid for: because it is postponed, cancelled, or does not reach the minimum
          size: you may move your place to the next cohort or take a full refund, whichever you prefer. Tell us which and
          we will process it within 14 working days.
