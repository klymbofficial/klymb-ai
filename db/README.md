# The database

klymb.ai and [app.klymb.ai](https://app.klymb.ai) share one Neon Postgres
database, so there is one user base rather than two. app.klymb.ai owns the
`public` schema through Prisma (148 models, 13k+ users); this app owns the
`course` schema, and the two meet at one foreign key:

```
course.learners.user_id  →  public."User".id
```

`course.learners.email` stays the operative key — it is the Google-verified
identity everything authorises against, and every query filters on it.
`user_id` is the link that makes a real join possible. It is null for a course
registrant with no app.klymb.ai account yet, which is fine; a registration here
never creates a platform account.

## Why a separate schema

- **Prisma stays out of our way.** app.klymb.ai's `schema.prisma` has no
  `multiSchema` and no `schemas` list, so Prisma manages `public` alone and
  never sees `course`. Our tables in `public` would read as drift, and
  `prisma migrate dev` would offer to reset them.
- **Blast radius.** The app connects as a role with privileges on `course` and
  nothing else. It is structurally unable to read or write the platform's
  tables, beyond `(id, email)` of `"User"` for the lookup above. That is
  tighter than the Supabase setup it replaced, where the service-role key
  bypassed row-level security on every table in the database.

Nothing collides by name either: Prisma's tables are `"User"`, `"Account"`…
while ours are `learners`, `registrations`…

## Setting it up

Do this against a **Neon branch of production** first, and repoint to
production only once the verification below passes.

1. **Confirm the target.** `ABtalksapp/.env.local` lists more than one Neon
   endpoint. Take the production one from the `abtalksapp` project's Vercel
   environment, not the local file, and confirm the 13k+ users are in it:

   ```sql
   select count(*) from "User";
   ```

2. **Create the application role**, as the database owner, with a password you
   generate. It is a secret, so it does not live in this repo:

   ```sql
   create role klymb_course with login password '<generated>';
   ```

3. **Apply the schema.** `DATABASE_MIGRATE_URL` is the owner connection (it
   needs to create tables); `DATABASE_URL` is the `klymb_course` one the app
   runs as. Both belong in `.env.local`, and the app's in Vercel.

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

   Migrations are applied in filename order, once each, recorded in
   `course.schema_migrations`. Each file runs in one transaction with its
   ledger row, so a failure leaves nothing behind. `0002_grants.sql` is a no-op
   until the role exists, so the order of steps 2 and 3 does not matter.

4. **Point `DATABASE_URL` at the `-pooler` host.** This database serves
   app.klymb.ai's users as well, and the connection budget is not ours alone to
   spend. The pool in `src/lib/db/client.ts` is deliberately small.

## Verifying

```sql
-- Ours are all in course, none in public.
select table_schema, count(*) from information_schema.tables
 where table_name in ('learners','registrations','payments','day_submissions',
                      'assessment_results','support_tickets','admin_audit_log',
                      'push_subscriptions','rate_limit_events','admin_users')
 group by table_schema;

-- As klymb_course: the first is refused, the second works.
select * from "User" limit 1;
select id, email from "User" limit 1;
```

In the app.klymb.ai checkout, `npx prisma migrate status` must report no drift:
that is what proves `course` is invisible to Prisma.

## Operations

Everything routine happens in one place: `/api/cron/followups`, hourly, from
`.github/workflows/followups.yml`. It calls `course.maintenance()` and then
refreshes a batch of commit counts, before it does anything with email — so
housekeeping still runs when email is not configured. Its JSON response says
what it did, which is the quickest way to see whether the cron is alive.

**`course.maintenance()`** deletes rate-limit attempts older than a day (in
bounded batches, so it never takes a long lock), creates the `sd_events`
partitions for the next couple of months, drops the ones that have aged
out, and deletes LinkedIn connections whose 60-day token has expired
(`0008_linkedin.sql` redefines it to add that last step).

**`course.sd_events` is partitioned by month.** It is the only table whose
growth is driven by visitors rather than enrolments — a free 21-day course
streaming events every few seconds adds up fast. Two consequences worth
knowing:

- **Retention is a `DROP TABLE`, not a `DELETE`.** Dropping a month is instant
  and gives the disk space back; deleting a month of rows is a long write
  transaction that leaves the space as bloat until a vacuum. Change the window
  by passing `p_keep_sd_months` to `maintenance()`. It keeps whole calendar
  months — the current one plus that many before it — so the real window is
  three to four months wide at the default of 3, not a flat ninety days.
- **There is a `default` partition** so an event with an unexpected date is
  never dropped. Nothing should normally land there. If something does, it
  permanently blocks creating the partition for that month, and
  `ensure_sd_partitions` will say so with a notice rather than failing the
  cron. Check with:

  ```sql
  select count(*) from course.sd_events_default;
  ```

**Commit counts are refreshed, not fetched.** `course.learners.commit_days`
is filled in by the cron, 150 learners per run, stalest first. It used to be
counted while the admin page rendered — one `commitDays()` per learner, each
making up to three GitHub requests, against a 5,000/hour budget shared with
the `checkFreshPush` call that learners need in order to submit. If the
numbers feel stale, raise `COMMIT_BATCH` in `src/lib/learner/commits.ts`; the
arithmetic for what that costs is in the comment above it. `commit_days` is
null when a learner has not been checked yet, which is different from zero
commits.

## Adding a migration

A new numbered file in `db/migrations/`. Never edit an applied one — the runner
warns when a file's checksum has changed, because the next environment will hit
it as a schema difference. Tables created later are usable by the app without
re-granting, via the default privileges set in `0002_grants.sql`.

Each file runs in a transaction. Put `-- migrate: no-transaction` on a line of
its own when it contains something Postgres refuses to run in one — in practice
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, which is how you add an index to a table large
enough that locking writes would be felt. Such a file is sent one statement at
a time and is responsible for being safe to re-run, since a failure part-way
leaves what it already did in place. If a concurrent build fails it leaves an
invalid index behind:

```sql
select indexrelid::regclass from pg_index where not indisvalid;
```

Drop what that lists, then run the migration again.

## History

`supabase/migrations/` is the retired Supabase schema. It is kept as history,
is applied nowhere, and `tests/migration.test.ts` pins what it said. Its
row-level security policies were already inert before the move: every one keyed
off `auth.jwt()` or `auth.uid()`, and this app authenticates with NextAuth and
Google without ever signing anyone into Supabase Auth.
